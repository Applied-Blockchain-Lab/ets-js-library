# ets-js-library

## About

This is a JavaScript library for interacting with event ticketing system. It creates unsigned transactions and fetches data from smart contracts and ipfs.

### Users of the system

- Visitor:
  Can search for events and buy tickets.
- Organizers of event:
  - Admin:
    Can control everything on his events.
  - Moderator:
    Can do everything except managing roles and deleting the event.
  - Cashier:
    Can operate with the funds collected from the event.
  - Validator:
    Can mark a ticket as "used".

## How to use

Install:

```bash
npm i ets-js-library
```

## Available functionalities in format _Action name (who has the right)_

### Create event (Everyone)

1. Create an api token from [nft.storage](https://nft.storage/)
2. Import createEvent function from the library.
3. Create metadata for the new event.
4. Execute creteEvent function. This will return an unsigned transaction.
5. Sign and send the transaction anyway you like.

```js
import { createEvent } from "ets-js-library";

const metadata = {
  name: "Event1",
  description: "Event1 Description",
  image: "Blob or File Object",
  properties: {
    websiteUrl: "https://event1.com",
    location: {
      country: "Country1",
      city: "Place1",
      address: "Address1",
      coordinates: {
        latitude: "00.000",
        longitude: "00.000",
      },
    },
    contacts: "Contacts",
    status: "upcoming",
    tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
  },
};

const contractData = {
  maxTicketPerClient: 5,
  startDate: 1666666666, // unix timestamp
  endDate: 1666666666, // unix timestamp

const key = "API key for NFT.storage";

const transaction = await createEvent(key, metadata, contractData);
//You need to sign and send the transaction after this.
```

const transaction = await sendInvitation(eventId, ticketIds, accounts);
//You need to sign and send the transaction after this.
```

### Get tickets of address for event (Admin or Moderator)

1. Import getAddressTicketIdsByEvent function from the library.
2. Execute getAddressTicketIdsByEvent function.

```js
import { getAddressTicketIdsByEvent } from "ets-js-library";

const eventId = "id of event";
const address = "0x...";

const tickets = await sendInvitation(eventId, address);
```

## Tests

Run tests:

```sh
npm install hardhat@esm
npm run test
```

See test coverage:

```sh
npm run coverage
```
